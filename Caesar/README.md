# Caesar Cipher

This is a project I worked on as a personal project while at Johns Hopkins University for a summer pre-college program with the NSLC.

During a class about cryptography, I got bored and tried implementing caesar ciphers in python, both encryptionand decryption. After
I finished that, I tried adding a functionality to brute force decrypt a key, even without a shift value. It uses a dataset of about 300,000
English words and sees if any words in the key are also in the dataset.
